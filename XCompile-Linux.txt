# Cross-compiling requires CMake 2.6 or newer. Example:
# cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../XCompile-Android.txt -DHOST=arm-linux-androideabi
# Where 'arm-linux-androideabi' is the host prefix for the cross-compiler. If
# you already have a toolchain file setup, you may use that instead of this
# file. Make sure to set CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH to where the NDK toolchain was
# installed (e.g. "$ENV{HOME}/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-r10c-21").

# the name of the target operating system
SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)

SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH "/usr")

# here is where stuff gets installed to
SET(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "${CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH}" CACHE STRING "Install path prefix, prepended onto install directories." FORCE)

# adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
# search headers and libraries in the target environment, search
# programs in the host environment
